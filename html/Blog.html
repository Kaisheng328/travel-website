          <h3>Sarawak Cultural Village</h3>
          <p class="fst-italic">
            Located at the foot of Mount Santubong, the Sarawak Cultural Village is a living museum that
            showcases the diverse cultures and traditions of Sarawak’s indigenous tribes. Visitors can explore
            authentic replicas of longhouses, traditional Malay houses, and Chinese farmhouses, each
            representing different ethnic groups such as the Iban, Bidayuh, and Orang Ulu. The village offers a
            unique opportunity to witness traditional dances, music, and crafts while learning about the rich
            heritage of Borneo’s native people. It’s a fascinating journey into the cultural tapestry of
            Sarawak, all in a scenic, lush environment.

          <h3>Semenggoh Nature Reserve</h3>
          <p class="fst-italic">
            A short drive from Kuching, Semenggoh Nature Reserve is a haven for wildlife lovers, particularly
            those interested in seeing orangutans in their natural habitat. This rehabilitation center cares for
            rescued and orphaned orangutans, gradually reintroducing them into the wild. Visitors can observe
            these magnificent primates during feeding times, often catching sight of them swinging through the
            trees or coming down for fruit. The reserve also offers nature trails, making it a serene escape
            into Borneo’s lush rainforest while supporting conservation efforts.

          <h3>Kuching Waterfront</h3>
          <p class="fst-italic">
            Stretching along the Sarawak River, the Kuching Waterfront is a beautiful promenade offering
            stunning views of the city’s skyline and historical landmarks. Lined with cafes, souvenir shops, and
            entertainment spots, it’s a popular spot for both locals and tourists to relax and take a stroll.
            Highlights include the picturesque Darul Hana Bridge, the modern Sarawak State Legislative Assembly
            building, and the Astana, a historic palace. As the sun sets, the waterfront comes alive with
            vibrant lights and local performances, creating a lively yet tranquil atmosphere.
